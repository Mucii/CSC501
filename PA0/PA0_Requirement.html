<h2 align="center">PA 0: Getting Acquainted with XINU</h2>
<h2 align="center">Due: September 3 2015, 4:00 AM</h2>



<h2>1. Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of this introductory lab are to familiarize you with the process of compiling and running XINU, 
the tools involved, and the run-time environment and segment layout.
</p>

<h2>2. Lab setup guide</h2>
XINU is a small Unix-like operating system originally 
developed by Douglas Comer for instructional purposes at Purdue University. It is
small enough so that we can understand it entirely within one semester.
As part of lab assignment, we will re-implement or improve some apsects of XINU.
<ol>
<p></p><p>Step 1: Setting environment variables for lab assignments: 
</p><ol>
Get access to a customized VCL image -- <i>XINU (CSC501)</i> -- through the <a href="http://vcl.ncsu.edu/">VCL</a> facility 
</ol>

<p>Step 2: Add a new entry into your /etc/hosts
</p><pre>	sudo sh -c "echo 127.0.0.1 `cs-status | head -1 | sed 's/://g'` &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts"
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Step 3: Start a backend server at local
</p><pre>	sudo /bin/serial_server &amp;
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Step 4: Untar the XINU source files as follows:
</p><ol>
<li>
Change to your home directory, if you are not already in it.</li>
<br>
<b>cd</b>
<p>
</p><li>

Untar the XINU source by typing the following:</li>

<br><b>wget http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA0/csc501-lab0.tgz</b><br>
<b>tar xzvf csc501-lab0.tgz</b>
<p>In your home directory, you will now have a directory named csc501-lab0.
The subdirectories under this directory contain source code, header files,
etc, for XINU. 
NOTE: the tar file name may be different from the above depending on the lab you are working
on. Please refer to the lab handouts for the location of the tar file for
the current lab.
</p></ol>


<p>Step 5: Building XINU</p><p>

</p><ol>
To compile the XINU kernel which will be downloaded and run on the backend
machines, run "make" in the compile directory as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><b>cd csc501-lab0/compile
make depend
make</b></pre>
This creates an OS image called 'xinu.elf' that will then be uploaded and run on the backend
machines.
</ol>

<p> Step 6: Running XINU
</p><ol>
The XINU code runs on backend machines. To see which of the backends are
available for booting XINU, type:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><b>cs-status</b></pre>
This will show you who, if anyone, is logged onto each backend and how
long they have been using it. To boot your copy of XINU on a backend, connect
to a back-end by issuing the command:
<pre><b>cs-console</b></pre>
With no arguments cs-console will connect you to the first available backend.
You may specify a backend by name (backend21 through backend100). Now download
your copy of XINU by typing:
<pre><b>(control-@) </b>OR <b>(control-spacebar)

</b>// esc to local command-mode&nbsp;


<b>(command-mode) ?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

// show a list of supported commands &nbsp;


<b>(command-mode) d</b>&nbsp;

// download command&nbsp;


<b>file: xinu.elf

</b>// tell it to download 'xinu.elf' (assuming you are under csc501-lab0/compile)


<b>(control-@)</b> OR <b>(control-spacebar)

</b>// esc to local command-mode&nbsp;


<b>(command-mode) p&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

// powercycle the backend &nbsp;


XINU should boot with a "Hello World, Xinu lives!" message.

</pre>
Typing (control-@) will always bring you back to '(command mode)' prompt.
From here, you can quit by typing <b>q</b>. 
<br>&nbsp;

<pre><b>(control-@) </b>OR <b>(control-spacebar)

<b>(command-mode) q&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

// quit the backend &nbsp;
</b></pre><b>

</b>

<h2>4. What to do</h2>
<p>
You will be using the <tt>csc501-lab0.tgz</tt> you have downloaded and compiled by following the lab setup guide. And you are asked to write several XINU functions that perform the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li><b><tt>long zfunction(long param)</tt></b></li>
<p> Clear the 20th to 27th bits (count the bits from left to right) of the
    parameter "param" and shift it by 8 bits to the left, and then fill the
    right most bits with 0. For example, the input parameter <tt>0xaabbccdd</tt>
    should generate a return value of <tt>0xbbc00d00</tt>. You can assume that
    the size of long is 4 bytes. The code for this function should be entirely
    written in x86 assembly. You should not use inline assembly, (i.e., do not
    use <tt>asm(...)</tt>). To investigate the assembly code generated by the
    compiler, you can use the tool <tt>objdump -d &lt;___.o&gt;</tt> to
    disassemble an object file.  The object files reside in the
    <tt>/compile</tt> directory within the main Xinu directory. You can also see
    some of the *.S files in the <tt>/sys</tt> directory for reference.</p>

<li><b><tt>void printsegaddress()</tt></b></li>
<p> Print the addresses indicating the end of the text, data, and BSS segments
    of the Xinu OS. Also print the 4-byte contents (in hexadecimal) preceding
    and after those addresses. This function can be written in C.</p>

<li><b><tt>void printtos()</tt></b></li>
<p> Print the address of the top of the run-time stack for whichever process you
    are currently in, right before and right after you get into the
    <tt>printtos()</tt> function call. In addition, print the contents of upto
    six stack locations below the top of the stack (six or fewer items that
    have been the most recently pushed, if any). Remember
    that stack elements are 32 bits wide, and be careful to perform pointer
    arithmetic correctly.  Also note that there are local variables and
    arguments on the stack, among other things. See the hints given for #4
    below, especially on stacktrace.c and proc.h. Your function can be written
    entirely in C, or you can use in-line assembly if you prefer.</p>

<li><b><tt>void printprocstks(int priority)</tt></b></li>
<p> For each existing process with lower priority than the parameter, print the
    stack base, stack size, stacklimit, and stack pointer. Also, for each
    process, include the process name, the process id and the process
    priority.</p>

<p> To help you do this, please look into <tt>proc.h</tt> in the <tt>h/</tt>
    directory.  Note the <tt>proctab[]</tt> array that holds all processes.
    Also, note that the pesp member of the pentry structure holds the saved
    stack pointer.  Therefore, the currently executing process has a stack
    pointer that is different from the value of this variable.  In order to help
    you get the  stack pointer of the currently executing process, carefully
    study the <tt>stacktrace.c</tt> file in the <tt>sys/</tt> directory.  The
    register <tt>%esp</tt> holds the current stack pointer.  You can use in-line
    assembly(i.e., <tt>asm("...")</tt>) to do this part.</p>
 
<li><b><tt>void printsyscalls()</tt></b></li>
<p> Print the system calls which have been invoked for each process. This task
    is loosely based on the functionality of
    <a href="http://lttng.org/">LTTng </a>. There are 43 system calls declared.
    Please look into <tt>kernel.h</tt> in the <tt>h/</tt> directory to see all
    declared system calls. However, not all of them are implemented in this XINU
    version. The implementation of the system calls are in the <tt>sys/</tt>
    directory. You are asked to focus on the system calls in
    <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA0/syscalls.txt">this list</a>. <br>
    You are asked to print the frequency (how many times each system call is invoked) of the system calls in
    <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/gjin2/Classes/501/Fall2015/assignments/PA0/syscalls.txt">the list</a> for each process. In order to do this, you will need to modify the implementation of the system calls  to trace them whenever they are invoked. <br>
		You will also need to implement two other functions: <br>
		<b><tt>void syscallsummary_start()</tt></b>: to start tracing the system calls. <br>
		<b><tt>void syscallsummary_stop()</tt></b>: to stop tracing the system calls. <br>	
		In other words, these two functions determine the duration in which the system calls are traced. <br>
		</p>

</ol>

<p> Implement this lab as a set of functions that can be called from
    <tt>main()</tt>.  Each function should reside in a separate file in the sys
    directory, and should be incorporated into the Makefile.  The files should
    be named after the functions they are implementing with C files having the
    .c extension and the assembly files having the .S extension.  For example,
    the file that will hold  <tt>void printsegaddress()</tt> should be named
    <tt>printsegaddress.c</tt>; and the file that will hold
    <tt>long zfunction(long param)</tt> should be named <tt>zfunction.S</tt>.
    You should put <tt> syscallsummary_start, syscallsummary_stop </tt>
    functions in the same file as <tt>printsyscalls</tt> function and
    name it as <tt>printsyscalls.c</tt>. If you require a header file,
    please name it <tt>lab0.h</tt>.  Note: as you create new files, you may need
    to update the <tt>Makefile</tt> (located in the <tt>compile/</tt>directory)
    to configure it to compile your files correctly. Just look at what is done
    for the existing files (e.g., <tt>main.c</tt>) to see what you have to do.
</p>

<h2>5. Additional Questions</h2>
 
 
<p>Write your answers to the following questions in a file named Lab0Answers.txt (in simple text).</p>
<p>Please place this file in the sys/ directory and turn it in, along with the above programming assignment.</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Assuming the XINU text begins at address <tt>0x0</tt>, draw a rough diagram of XINU's memory layout with addresses derived from your experimental measurements.  Include the information you uncovered from running your version of <tt>printsegaddress()</tt> and <tt>printprocstks()</tt>.</li>
<li>What is the difference in stack top address before and after calling <tt>printtos()</tt>? Draw a diagram to illustrate what are the contents of the items pushed into the stack between these two time points.</li>
<li>Which byte order is adopted in the host machine that we are using? How did you find out?</li>
<li>Briefly describe the <tt>mov, push, pusha, pop,</tt> and <tt>popa</tt> instructions in the x86.</li>
<li>In a stack frame, local variables are stored below the top of the stack.  In task 3, does your result show all the local variables declared in your <b>printtos</b> function?  If not, can you explain that? (hint: try to disable the compiler optimization by specifing -O0 in your Makefile)</li>
</ol>
