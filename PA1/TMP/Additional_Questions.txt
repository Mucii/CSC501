What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies and the original scheduling policy in XINU?

1.The advantage of LINUXLIKE scheduler is that it can prevent starvation caused by some always running processes with high priority, improve the response time and effieciency.  It is a balance between resopons time and turn around time.  While its disadvangement is its turn around time may not so good.

2.For the MULTIQUEUE scheduler, its advantage is to differentiate processes acordding to their needs.  For the real-time processes it can acheive better response time.  But because most of the time, i.e. 70% here in our assignment, the normal process can not get the chance to run for the whole epoch, which will perform awful when their is a lot of real-time processes exist.  Under this situation, the normal processes, even with high priority has to wait for the whole epoch to start running.
